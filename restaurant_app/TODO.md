# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 2

## PWA - Offline data, performance and accessability

### CRITERIA

1. Fork and clone the server repository. Youâ€™ll use this development server to develop your project code.
2. Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.
3. Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
5. Submit your project code for review.

### MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

1. The client application should pull restaurant data from the development server, parse the JSON response, and use the information to render the appropriate sections of the application UI.

2. The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline.

3. The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports.

4. The application retains accessibility features from the Stage 1 project. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly.

5. Lighthouse targets for each category exceed:

* Progressive Web App: >90
* Performance: >70
* Accessibility: >90
